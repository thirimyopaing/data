                 Two very different stories that revolved around Batman's eternal conflict with the Joker have recently come to a close in James Tynion IV and Jorge Jimenez's "Joker War" and Geoff Johns and Jason Fabok's Batman: Three Jokers. The two tales revolved around the Clown Prince of Crime coming at the Dark Knight and Bat-Family in a more personal way than ever, as the supervillain was well aware of the team's various secret identities. Despite their differences, the two stories work perfectly as companion pieces exploring Batman and the Joker's never-ending battle, especially with Johns confirming he regards Three Jokers as canon to the main DC Universe."

                 In regards to canon, when Three Jokers and "Joker War" take place in relation to one another is one of those continuity questions perhaps better left unexplored. Alfred Pennyworth appears alive and well throughout the course of Three Jokers while his death looms large over the Bat-Family during the events of "Joker War." Jim Gordon doesn't know his daughter's identity as Batgirl while Barbara tacitly reveals her double life to him in a moment of anger at the end of Three Jokers. Finally, Jason Todd drops his Red Hood persona at the end of Three Jokers to impress Barbara but is seen dropping the alter ego under much different circumstances in immediate aftermath of  "Joker War."

                 As the X-Men prepare for battle in X Of Swords, the newly reconstituted Otherworld is on display. The arena for the great tournament finds many of its roots in a run of Captain Britain stories, helmed by one of the most renowned comic book writers living today, Alan Moore.Captain Britain who derives his powers from the Amulet of Right, bequeathed to him by supernatural beings of English lore, Merlyn and his daughter Roma, has often been depicted as part of a larger multiversal Captain Britain Corps that gets introduced for the first time here.

                When Brian Braddock, the Captain Britain of Earth-616 faces The Fury head on, he loses his life as well. Merlin and Roma manage to reconstruct and resurrect Brian, sending him back to his original Earth in the process. From here he reunites with his sister, Elizabeth Braddock, now sporting purple hair. Not only would Betsy Braddock become Psylocke of X-Men fame, but she would later take up the Amulet of Right herself, serving as Captain Britain and one of Krakoa’s swordbearers in X Of Swords. It’s Moore who first explores her psychic and precognitive powers as a member of STRIKE, the corrupted British equivalent of SHIELD.                </div>

        Gwen Stacy's death is one of the worst tragedies to befall Spider-Man in over a half-century of being a superhero. But now, one of his greatest new allies just revisited the crime in the worst possible way -- almost killing another hero in the process.

                Thanks to the actions of Kindred and Sin-Eater, the sins of various Marvel villains have been collected and stolen away. While this leaves the villains in a perpetual state of powerless self-pity and remorse, their sins have been turned into a powerful possessive force that Kindred then unleashed against the Web-Warriors. This led to the various Spider-Heroes (all save for Peter Parker himself, who was spared so he could suffer from the realization of what's happening) to become possessed and controlled by Kindred. Since then, these demonic Spider-Heroes have been laying waste to New York City and decimating plenty of heroes, including the New Warriors. <br>Throughout the city, the Web-Warriors utilize their own abilities and gifts to wreak havoc in their new demonic forms. They are also amplified by the mysterious energies that were collected by the Sin-Eater and make them conduits for Kindred. It's not long at all before the unleashed Web-Warriors quickly tear apart various innocents around the city, attacking the likes of the New York Police Department and even bringing down the beams holding up the George Washinton Bridge. </div>

                 Throughout the one-shot, Talos recounts his narrow escape from the evil god of symbiotes after Knull decimates a Kree/Skrull alliance armada. By the end of the issue, it’s abundantly clear that the universe itself is in danger, and Knull looks unstoppable. <br>Early on, Talos describes how the Kree/Skrull outposts on several planets have gone entirely silent, a pattern that’s particularly disturbing because the path of the planets forms a trajectory. When Talos’ crew finds some escape pods that came from these outposts, they’re shocked to find that they contain symbiotes. In a scene that’s right out of a horror movie, the aliens attack the crew and prove that they're more powerful than ever. But this assault is only the beginning of the nightmare.

                This revelation lines up with a similar development in Guardians of the Galaxy #8. At the end of this issue, Zoralis Gupa, an attendee of an intergalactic conference, informs everyone that the end of everything is beginning, as a malevolent force is systematically wiping out planets. Gupta says that the final transmission from his now-decimated homeworld shared the monster’s name: Knull. With the beginning of a Snarkwar and the symbiote god's path of terror, the Guardians of the Galaxy certainly have their hands full. </div>
